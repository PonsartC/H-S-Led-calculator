# Led calculator project
This projets has been done for the lesson of Hardware and Software given by Pr. Valderama at Polytechnical Faculty of Mons (Belgium).

This project was inspired by the tutorial on http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-and-intuitive-web-interface-for-your-Raspbe/.

The goal is to make a calculator using PHP, and the result is reading on a serie of LED.

# Electronic components
- 1 Raspberry Pi
- 10 Leds (or more, or les)
- 10 wires (the same as the Leds)
- 1 Ethernet Wire
- Bread board
To access the Raspberry Py, we  use X2Go.
